# v0.4.0

## New Features

- **Headless mode** - Run tests non-interactively with `octrafic test`. Supports file-based execution (Postman, curl scripts, pytest) and prompt-based execution with a spec file. Returns exit code `0` on success, `1` on failure - ready for CI/CD pipelines.

- **Export tests** - Ask the AI to export executed tests to Postman Collection, bash curl script, or pytest. Files are saved to `~/Documents/octrafic/tests/`.

- **Auto mode** - Use `--auto` flag or `/auto` command to run tests without manual confirmation. Status bar shows an indicator when active.

- **Save temporary projects** - Convert a temporary project to a named one mid-session with `/save <name>`. Full conversation history is preserved.

- **Release notes history** - `/release-notes` now shows the last 5 releases instead of only the latest.
